## For users : 

You might've stumbled upon this repository searching for the actual website. [Click here to be whisked away!](https://communitty.herokuapp.com). If you are a developer, look below!

## For developers :

The production version of the app should be deployed from the `main` branch [here](https://communitty.herokuapp.com). For developer builds, take a look into the `dev` branch. Please create all pull requests to the `dev` branch.

To run a live development build (frontend+backend hot reload using nodemon), use `npm run dev`. It will initialize the server, and client, and hot reload whenever any changes are made to either files. The app should be visible on port `8800`. If a port is specified using environment variables, use that port.
